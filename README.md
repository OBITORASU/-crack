# hashcracker is a hash cracking script made in python

`hashcracker` is a python script which uses a dictionary attack on supported hashing algorithms to crack the provided hashes. Currently `hashcracker` supports some of the most common algorithms a penetration tester might encounter namely sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512 and md5. ```hashcracker``` is implemented using ```hashlib``` in Python.

## Prerequisites:
- `python 3`
- `a good wordlist`

## Installation:
Step 1:
```
git clone https://github.com/OBITORASU/hashcracker.git
```
Step 2:
```
cd hashcracker
```
Step 3:
```
python hashcracker.py
```

**NOTE**

I have not provided any wordlist with my code so you will have to find a good wordlist yourself to get cracking.
